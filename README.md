Consult the `/tests/*.Tests.ps1` files in the repo for samples of how to use this module to build and deploy.

Each Function should have it's own helping headers... eventually.

The basic process is

* Set up variables to build and deploy
* Check if VS Build Tools 2017 is Installed and Install if not
* Install Microsoft.Data.Tools.MSBuild.
* Build sqlproj file
* Deploy DACPAC

### How To Install Prerequisites

#### LocalDB

Use either [Get-LocalDb2016](https://github.com/RichieBzzzt/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/blob/master/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/Functions/GetLocalDb2016.ps1) or [Get-LocalSB2016NuGet](https://github.com/RichieBzzzt/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/blob/master/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/Functions/GetLocalDb2016NuGet.ps1) to download the LocalDB MSI to a working folder. Then pas MSI when executing [Install-LocalDB2016](https://github.com/RichieBzzzt/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/blob/master/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/Functions/InstallLocalDb2016.ps1).

All of these functions can be re-run, so if MSI already downloaded or LocalDB already installed then it won't re-try. 

This test script includes a step to create a localdb instance to deploy to. Therefore this test script shouldrun without having to set up anything else.

#### MSBuild Tools
Use [Install-VsBuildTools2017](https://github.com/RichieBzzzt/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/blob/master/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/Functions/InstallVsBuildTools2017.ps1) to check if latest MSBuild Tools is installed. If not then function will download and install. Elevated permissions are required!

### How To Build SSDT Project
Use [Invoke-MsBuildSSDT](https://github.com/RichieBzzzt/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/blob/master/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/Functions/InvokeMSBuildSSDT.ps1), passing in the file path to the solution or the project. The path to Data.Tools.MSBuild is also required -

```powershell

$WWI = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "wwi-dw-ssdt"
$WWI_SLN = Join-Path $WWI "\WideWorldImportersDW.sqlproj"
$WWI_DAC = Join-Path $WWI "\Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild\lib\net46"
Install-MicrosoftDataToolsMSBuild -WorkingFolder $WWI
Invoke-MsBuildSSDT -DatabaseSolutionFilePath $WWI_SLN -DataToolsFilePath $WWI_DAC 
```

The above sample set the path to the directory where the sqlproj file is, and also used this as the working directory to download the NuGet package. This means the dlls etc were local to the project.

### How Do I Catch Errors From The Build?

Use ```$lastexitcode``` when invoking the function ```Invoke-MSBuildSSDT```. This will tell you if the build is successful or not.

```powershell
$WWI = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "wwi-dw-ssdt"
$WWI_SLN = Join-Path $WWI "\WideWorldImportersDW.sqlproj"
$WWI_DAC = Join-Path $WWI "\Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild\lib\net46"
Install-MicrosoftDataToolsMSBuild -WorkingFolder $WWI
Invoke-MsBuildSSDT -DatabaseSolutionFilePath $WWI_SLN -DataToolsFilePath $WWI_DAC 
if ($lastexitcode -ne 0){
  throw
}
```

### How To Publish DACPAC

Use [Publish-DatabaseDeployment](https://github.com/RichieBzzzt/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/blob/master/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/Functions/PublishDatabaseDeployment.ps1), passing in the location to the dac dll, the location of the dac dll, the publish file and the dacpac.

As of version 2, there are four new options on the function -

* -GenerateDeploymentScript - boolean - determines whether Deployment Script is generated.
* -GenerateDeployMentReport - boolean - determines whether Deployment Report is generated.
* -ScriptPath - string - folder path where the scriptsa re goingto be created.
* -ScriptOnly (optional, see **How To Only Script Changes Instaead of Deploying?** for more info)

```powershell
$WWI = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "wwi-dw-ssdt"
$WWI_DAC = Join-Path $WWI "\Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild\lib\net46"
$WWI_DACFX = Join-Path $WWI_DAC "\Microsoft.SqlServer.Dac.dll"
$WWI_DACPAC = Join-Path $WWI "\bin\Debug\WideWorldImportersDW.dacpac"
$WWI_PUB = Join-Path $WWI "\bin\Debug\WideWorldImportersDW.publish.xml"

#deploy
Publish-DatabaseDeployment -dacfxPath $WWI_DACFX -dacpac $WWI_DACPAC -publishXml $WWI_PUB -targetConnectionString $svrConnstring -targetDatabaseName $WWI_NAME -GenerateDeploymentScript $false -GenerateDeployMentReport $false -ScriptPath $WWI #-getSqlCmdVars

Publish-DatabaseDeployment -dacfxPath $WWI_DACFX -dacpac $WWI_DACPAC -publishXml $WWI_PUB -targetConnectionString $svrConnstring -targetDatabaseName $WWI_NAME -GenerateDeploymentScript $true -GenerateDeployMentReport $false -ScriptPath $WWI #-getSqlCmdVars

Publish-DatabaseDeployment -dacfxPath $WWI_DACFX -dacpac $WWI_DACPAC -publishXml $WWI_PUB -targetConnectionString $svrConnstring -targetDatabaseName $WWI_NAME -GenerateDeploymentScript $false -GenerateDeployMentReport $true -ScriptPath $WWI #-getSqlCmdVars

Publish-DatabaseDeployment -dacfxPath $WWI_DACFX -dacpac $WWI_DACPAC -publishXml $WWI_PUB -targetConnectionString $svrConnstring -targetDatabaseName $WWI_NAME -GenerateDeploymentScript $true -GenerateDeployMentReport $true -ScriptPath $WWI #-getSqlCmdVars

#script only
Publish-DatabaseDeployment -dacfxPath $WWI_DACFX -dacpac $WWI_DACPAC -publishXml $WWI_PUB -targetConnectionString $svrConnstring -targetDatabaseName $WWI_NAME -GenerateDeploymentScript $true -GenerateDeployMentReport $false -ScriptPath $WWI -ScriptOnly #-getSqlCmdVars

Publish-DatabaseDeployment -dacfxPath $WWI_DACFX -dacpac $WWI_DACPAC -publishXml $WWI_PUB -targetConnectionString $svrConnstring -targetDatabaseName $WWI_NAME -GenerateDeploymentScript $false -GenerateDeployMentReport $true -ScriptPath $WWI -ScriptOnly #-getSqlCmdVars

Publish-DatabaseDeployment -dacfxPath $WWI_DACFX -dacpac $WWI_DACPAC -publishXml $WWI_PUB -targetConnectionString $svrConnstring -targetDatabaseName $WWI_NAME -GenerateDeploymentScript $true -GenerateDeployMentReport $true -ScriptPath $WWI -ScriptOnly #-getSqlCmdVars
```

Above example again sets the location of the source folder and creates the relative paths.

### I need to Deploy with the Latest Version of DacFX... How Do I Do This?

Install the latest version of DacFx by using ```Install-MicrosoftSqlServerDacFxx64```; currently this Nuget package is updated more regularly than the MSBuild one mentione above. For example., as of December 2018, you will need the DacFx NuGet package to deploy to a Managed Instance. This function is practically identical to the MSBuild one mentioned above.

```powershell

Example 1) Download latest NuGet package to PSScriptRoot
$workingFolder = $PSScriptRoot
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $WorkingFolder
$dacX64 = Join-Path $WorkingFolder "\Microsoft.SqlServer.DacFx.x64\lib\net46"
if ((Test-Path $dacX64) -eq $false) {
    Install-MicrosoftDataToolsMSBuild -WorkingFolder $workingFolder
}
if ((Test-Path $dacX64) -eq $false) {
    Write-Output "Oh! It looks like dacX64 did not download."
}
```

### How To Update SQLCMDVars in a Publish.XML File
If you have SqlCmdVariables that need updating, you can do this by including the 'getSqlCmdVars' switch when executing the [Publish-DatabaseDeployment](https://github.com/RichieBzzzt/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/blob/master/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/Functions/PublishDatabaseDeployment.ps1) Function. 
By adding this swtich the function [Get-SqlCmdVars](https://github.com/RichieBzzzt/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/blob/master/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/Functions/GetSqlCmdVars.ps1) is executed. This will attempt to resolve SQLCmd variables via matching powershell variables explicitly defined in the current context.
So in the [publish.xml](https://github.com/RichieBzzzt/PoshSSDTBuildDeploy/blob/master/tests/wwi-dw-ssdt/WideWorldImportersDW.publish.xml) file there is a SqlCmdVariable called  "DeployTag" with a value of "OldValue". If I want to overwrite this then you will need a PowerShell variable ```$DeployTag``` with a new value. if a variable is not found with this value then it will fail if the Switch ```FailOnMissingVars``` is included. If there are any missing vars and this switch is not included it will simply write an info message and move on. My post on my blog shows how to [Update XML With PowerShell With Elements](https://bzzzt.io/2017/10/31/updating-xml-with-powershell-now-including-elements/).
```powershell
$DeployTag = "NewValue"
Publish-DatabaseDeployment -dacfxPath $WWI_DACFX -dacpac $WWI_DACPAC -publishXml $WWI_PUB -targetConnectionString $svrConnstring -targetDatabaseName $WWI_NAME #-getSqlCmdVars
```

### Update SQLCMDVars if calling Functions from a script

If you are using a script to import the module and execute the deployment using something like VSTS you may need to set the variables with the values to update the SQLCMDVars in the publish xml. The below script sets the parameters to global

```powershell
[cmdletbinding()]
param (
\s[parameter(Mandatory = $true)] $WorkingFolder,
 [parameter(Mandatory = $false)] $serverName,
 [parameter(Mandatory=$false)] [string] $sqlAdministratorLogin,
 [parameter(Mandatory=$false)] [String] $sqlAdministratorLoginPassword,
 [parameter(Mandatory=$false)] [String] $connectionString,
 [parameter(Mandatory = $true)] [string] $DatabaseName,
 [parameter(Mandatory = $true)] [string] $DacpacPath,
 [parameter(Mandatory = $true)] [string] $PublishProfile,
 [parameter(Mandatory = $false)] [switch] $getSqlCmdVars,
 [parameter(Mandatory = $true)] [string] $deploytag

)

Set-Variable -Name "deploytag" -Value $deploytag -Scope Global

if ($PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey('connectionString') -eq $false) {
[string] $connectionString = "Server=tcp:$($serverName),1433;Initial Catalog=$($DatabaseName);Persist Security Info=False;User ID=$($sqlAdministratorLogin);Password=$($sqlAdministratorLoginPassword);MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;"
}
try {
 Find-Module -Name "PoshSSDTBuildDeploy"
}
catch {
 Write-Host "No PoshSSDTBuildDeploy, Installing from PSGallery."
    Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Force -Scope CurrentUser
    Install-Module PoshSSDTBuildDeploy -Force -Scope CurrentUser
}
finally {
 Write-Host "Importing PoshSSDTBuildDeploy."
 Import-Module PoshSSDTBuildDeploy -Force
}

$dacFxFolder = Install-MicrosoftDataToolsMSBuild -WorkingFolder $WorkingFolder

$dacFX = Join-Path -Path $dacFxFolder -ChildPath "\Microsoft.SqlServer.Dac.dll"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$WorkingFolder\deployScripts"

$PublishParams = @{
        dacfxPath                = $dacFX
        dacpac                   = (Resolve-Path $DacpacPath)
        publishXml               = (Resolve-Path $PublishProfile)
        targetConnectionString   = $connectionString
        targetDatabaseName       = $databaseName
        scriptPath               = $WorkingFolder
        GenerateDeploymentReport = $true
        GenerateDeploymentScript = $true
 }
 if ($UserName) {
 $PublishParams.Add("SqlCredential", (New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($UserName, $Password)))
}

if ($PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey('getSqlCmdVars') -eq $true) {
 $PublishParams.Add("GetSqlCmdVars", $true)
}

  Publish-DatabaseDeployment  @PublishParams
  ```

### How To Only Script Changes Instead of Deploying?

Use the ```-ScriptOnly``` Flag on Publish-DatabaseDeployment. For this to work either ```-GenerateDeployMentReport``` or ```-GenerateDeploymentScript``` must be set to ```$true``` as well as ```-ScriptPath```

### Making Use Of GenerateDeploymentReport

If the GenerateDeployMentReport Switch is included, you can make use of this report to get a better understanding as to what was deployed. By using the ```GenerateDeploymentSummary``` flag, the Publish function will run ```Get-OperationSummary``` and ```Get-OperationTotal``` functions and output the changes to the console in the form of pscustomobjects. It is now easier to determine what changes are going to be made. IE in the case below we are creating and dropping a few objects - 

![DeployReportinfoWithWarnings](img\\DeployReportAlertsAndSummariesJoined.PNG)

I have expereinced errors in running these functions on databases with very large number a of changes. Note that if this step fails yet all schema changes were the deploymentto the database should still considered to be successful.
